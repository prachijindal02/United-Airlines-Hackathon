‚úàÔ∏è Flight Difficulty Score (FDS) Analyzer
A Data-Driven Approach to Quantifying Operational Risk at Chicago O'Hare (ORD)

üìä Overview
The Flight Difficulty Score (FDS) is a predictive, weighted composite index designed to quantify the operational complexity and inherent delay risk of United Airlines departure flights at Chicago O'Hare (ORD).

This project moves beyond subjective planning by systematically scoring factors like ground time constraints, transfer baggage volume, and Special Service Requests (SSRs) before the aircraft arrives. The goal is to facilitate proactive resource allocation to the highest-risk flights, mitigating preventable delays and improving overall on-time performance.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology: The FDS Model
The FDS is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100 using a Weighted Composite Index model.

üí° Key Findings (Based on Sample Data )
The analysis reveals critical bottlenecks in the ORD operation:
Systemic Risk:  of flights operate with a negative or critical ground buffer ( mins).
Difficulty Validation: Flights with a Negative Ground Buffer showed an average FDS of  (Difficult), confirming the model‚Äôs focus.
Transfer Baggage Load: Flights classified as Difficult had an average Transfer Bag Count of , more than double the count for Medium flights.

üöÄ Strategic Recommendations
Proactive Resource Allocation: Automatically assign a +1 dedicated crew to all flights classified in the Difficult category.
Minimum Buffer Enforcement: Implement a hard 15-minute ground buffer minimum for any flight scoring .
Expected Impact: Projected - reduction in average delay minutes for the highest-risk flights.
